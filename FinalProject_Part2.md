## User Research and Interviews
### Protocols:
#### Target Audience
- People who have limited understanding of concert dance forms like modern and ballet.
#### Representative Individuals to Interview
- My program cohort already has a demonstrated interest in the fine and performing arts, but few have extensive exposure to concert dance. <br/>
- A graphic designer who has little to no experience with dance, but lots with design.
#### Interview Script and Responses

#### Findings
While the dummy text blocks look dense, it was not my intention to imply that I would be writing that much content. Definetly something to keep in mind for future wireframes. 

## To Do List
- recreate visualizations with real data
- finalize story elements
- find a silver lining (too much doom and gloom)
