### *notes*
For the chart above from the [Dance/NYC](https://culturaldata.org/media/1452/state-of-nyc-dance-and-workforce-demographics-online-version.pdf) report, *State of NYC Dance and Workforce Demographics 2016*, I was initially thrown off by all the identical bar lengths even though the "Unrestricted Revenue" and "Total Expenses" values were all different. This seemed odd for a bar graph where the whole point is to highlight comparative differences. Then I realized it was the operating margin (the bar within the bar) that was the focus of the chart. The bar sizes for the percentages across the five categories are proportional in relation to each other, but not at all proportional to their respective budget bars. I just couldn't grasp what was most important with all the numbers on the chart. Why include the average revenue and expenses if youâ€™re not going to then correlate the operating margin to those values? I thought having the relationship of operating margin to budget size was an important piece of the story, but I really struggled to try and accurately reflect scale and include all the information on the original visualization. Especially because operating margin percentages kept getting bigger as the budgets got exponentially smaller. You can see in the first few sketches my attempts and trying to include relative scale. I thought perhaps some variation of a stack bar chart or treemap might work.
