# Part I: Final Project 

> **“We know of no other occupation that requires such extensive training, which is held in such esteem as a contribution to culture and pays so little.”** - William Baumol

## Outline
### Summary

Financial investment in professional dance training begins decades before the average person even chooses a career path, and yet the income stream for most dancers dries up before they reach the age of 35. Start early and end early, the cost of a formal dance education often vastly exceeds potential income oppurtunities over time.
### Structure
#### highlights of the story

- discrepancies in investment vs. income
- comparisons to cost and time of training required for other professions 
- small chance of success
- the cost of a second career

#### story arc

The story will follow the timeline of a dancer's career:
- the initial joys of discovery
- the sacrifices and struggles of pre-professional training
- the rewards and satisfaction at a performer's prime
- the decline from age and injury to a premature retirement
- the challenges of preparing for a second career

In highlighting the effort and investment of professional dancers, I hope broader awareness of the work behind the curtain will lead to increased appreciation of what the audience sees on stage.
