### *notes*
The data from [OECD](https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm) detailed the general government debt-to-GDP ratios and explained the implications for the sustainability of government finance, but it failed to offer up a benchmark of what was a "good" vs. "bad" value. So I pulled a 2010 report from the World Bank, [“Finding the Tipping Point—When Sovereign Debt Turns Bad”](http://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/509771468337915456/pdf/WPS5391.pdf). The estimations established a threshold of 77 percent debt-to-GDP ratio. I added this target percentage to the grid of line charts and used it to calculate the deviation in percentage points of each country in the OECD data.

I wanted to focus on how off target the U.S. has been through the years, and also how low they fall on the list in comparison to other OECD members. So I used red to draw attention to their poor performance and left all other country data grey. I wanted the animation to illustrate how this has changed potentially for the worse in the U.S. as the timeline moves forward. I was hoping somehow to imply the potential damage of this trend. While the general public might grasp the basic concept, I think the projected magnitude of monetary loss would really help. With additional data on GDP and this from the World Bank report: 
>"If debt is above this threshold, each additional percentage point of debt costs 0.017 percentage points of annual real growth."
I could effectively show an estimate of the financial damages in dollars.
