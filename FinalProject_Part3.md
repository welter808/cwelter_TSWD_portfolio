## Final Data Story
Made in [Shorthand](https://shorthand.com/) <br>
[*Ultimate Artistry, Unjust Rewards: Finding Value in the Dancer's Dream*](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/ultimate-artistry-unjust-rewards/index.html)

## Outline
### Summary
Financial investment in professional dance training begins decades before the average person even chooses a career path, and yet the income stream for most dancers dries up before they reach the age of 35. Start early and end early, the cost of a formal dance education often vastly exceeds potential income oppurtunities over time.
### Structure

- discrepancies in investment vs. income
- comparisons to cost and time of training required for other professions 
- small chance of success
- the cost of a second career
