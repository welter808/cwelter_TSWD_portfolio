# Final Project: Part III
> **“We know of no other occupation that requires such extensive training, which is held in such esteem as a contribution to culture and pays so little.”** - William Baumol

## But first, recaps...
[Part I](FinalProject_Part1.md)

[Part II](FinalProject_Part2.md)

## Outline
### Summary
Financial investment in professional dance training begins decades before the average person even chooses a career path, and yet the income stream for most dancers dries up before they reach the age of 35. Start early and end early, the cost of a formal dance education often vastly exceeds potential income oppurtunities over time.
