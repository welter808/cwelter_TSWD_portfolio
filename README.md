# about me
##### **Christi Welter** (*she/her/hers*) 
I grew up in Hawai'i, before moving to the mainland for a BS in Mathematics and a BFA in Dance with Distinction from the University of California, Santa Barbara. Although still harboring dreams of becoming an architect, I spent the last 20 years in New York and San Francisco building with muscle and bone instead of concrete and steel. I'm now a Masters of Arts Management student at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. I love drinking hot toddies, walking my dog Mamet, and taking photos of abandoned stuffed animals.
